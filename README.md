# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Project

## Challenge/Project Summary:

An airline company decided to launch a passenger survey and the results showed that the satisfaction rate dipped under 50% for the first time ever. The leadership team decided to take actions fast analyzing the data and finding the key areas to focus on in order to get the company back on track.
Based on these assumptions, I built a Power BI dashboard.

## About the dataset:
Customer satisfaction scores from 120,000+ airline passengers, including additional information about each passenger, their flight, type of travel, as well as their classification (from 1 to 5) of many different factors like cleanliness, comfort, service and overall experience.
By analyzing these factors, the dashboard aims to provide a detailed understanding of the overall passenger experience and identify improvement areas.
